## Day 1 Overview

Day one. April fools day. I'm going to try and establish some initial goals and ideas for my project this month. My goal here is to develop a style guide for my personal site that I can eventually implement. Along with this, I want to development utility classes that help implement page layout and branding quickly.

I also want to develop a responsive type layout that can been seen visually on the style guide. I want to make sure that this has all of the class names available for quick copying along with examples of implementation.

Aside from type, I want to develop some visual elements that can be unique accents to the site.

I'm going to try and work with css custom properties as well as a random color generator mixin that will use HSLA to generate complementary colors.(see this link)[https://v6.robweychert.com/blog/2018/02/v6-color/]

Reference Frank Chimero public redesign for inspiration and research scss/ css naming conventions. I think it would be worth developing a best practice for structuring and naming style sheets and modules.

This feels brief but I'm tired. More to come soon.

## Minor Pivot

#### April 5th update

I'm going to build out styles for the knuckleheads site and brand. I'm also going to use this as my demo page for the home page rework.

## Monthly Recap

This month was wild. My final project is a a home page banner and CBD product menu for the Knuckleheads website. I initially created the menu as HTML but I converted the cbd products to a JSON data file and then used the nunjucks templating language to loop through it and produce the menu. After doing so, I enjoy how clean the HTML / nunjuck file is. The JSON file is nice and organized by collection type and is easily collapsible.

I want to focus more on styling and building utility classes as I initially had set out to do. I copied over what little style guide HTML I have for the May project as I intend to continue that. I spent nearly no time working on styling for a brand here. I was importing this info into the wordpress site and it wasn't worth really spending the time to overwrite styles here.

It was fun creating the CBD menu and was a great way to test out templating. I think this will translate well into the Shopify site I'm going to build.

I wasn't able to write any javascript this month, but I think I want to come back to the idea of using javascript to filter products based on info in the json files.

Overall, with the work-from-home and all this COVID-19 shit, I felt unmotivated. I'm cool with this though. I have to be at this point. All I can do is try my best next month.

Go work JG - Keep it going. JG
