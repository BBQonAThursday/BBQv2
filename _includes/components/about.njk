      <h1 class="heading-md pb-4">Hi! I'm Joel Gamble</h1>
      <p class="mb-4">Iâ€™m a web developer and designer currently working for Springs Window Fashions. I spend my developing new landing page experiences, product launches, and doing email marketing for our portfolio of 15+ brand websites.</p>
      <p>This site is built on Jekyll and uses a mix of TailwindCSS and my own brew of css utilities. I like the tailwind environment, but it is a bit excessive at times.</p>
      <p>In my free time, I like to disc golf, make pottery and play board games.</p>
